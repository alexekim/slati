<h1><strong>Smokefree Laws and Policies</strong></h1>
<p>According to the U.S. Surgeon General, secondhand smoke is a cause of lung cancer and coronary heart disease, and there is no risk-free level of exposure. Currently, 28 states and the <a href="http://www.lungusa2.org/slati/statedetail.php?stateId=11">District of Columbia</a> have passed comprehensive smokefree laws. No states have approved comprehensive smokefree laws in 2018 thus far.</p>

<p><strong><u>Smoking in Multi-Unit Housing</u></strong><br />
 Secondhand smoke seeping into apartments, condominiums and other multi-unit housing is just as toxic and hazardous as in being exposed in public places and workplaces. Here are some Lung Association materials that may&nbsp;be&nbsp;helpful.</p>
