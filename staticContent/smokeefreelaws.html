<!-- title: Smokefree Laws and Policies -->

<p>According to the U.S. Surgeon General, secondhand smoke is a cause of lung cancer and coronary heart disease, and there is no risk-free level of exposure. Currently, 28 states and the District of Columbia have passed comprehensive smokefree laws. No states have approved comprehensive smokefree laws in 2018 thus far.</p>

<h2>Smoking in Multi-Unit Housing</h2>
<p>
  Secondhand smoke seeping into apartments, condominiums and other multi-unit housing is just as toxic and hazardous as in being exposed in public places and workplaces. Here are some Lung Association materials that may be helpful.
