<!-- title: Funding for State Tobacco Control Programs -->

<p>Comprehensive tobacco control programs funded at or above levels recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are extremely effective at reducing smoking rates among both adults and youth. However, only three states, are funding their tobacco control program near CDC-recommended levels in FY2020 (July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020 for most states.)</p>
