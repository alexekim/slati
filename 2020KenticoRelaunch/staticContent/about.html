<p>The SLATI hard copy report was first published in 1988, and has been an exclusive publication of the American Lung Association since 1996. SLATI remains the only up-to-date guide to tobacco control laws in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Its evolution over the years has been marked by constant improvements in terms of content, range and analytical scope. SLATI includes information on state tobacco control laws and policy, covering issues such&nbsp;as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Individual Stateâ€™s Smoking Restrictions in Public Places and&nbsp;Workplaces<br></li>
  <li>Rate and History of Tobacco Excise&nbsp;Taxes<br></li>
  <li>Laws Regarding Youth Access to Tobacco and Sales to&nbsp;Minors<br></li>
  <li>State Spending on Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Programs and Use of dollars from state settlements with tobacco&nbsp;companies</li>
</ul>
<p>The last hard copy print edition (SLATI 2010) covered tobacco control laws effective as of January 1, 2011, but files approximating the hard copy version for years after this are available.  Editions of SLATI from previous years are also available, many of them in electronic form. Please <a href="mailto:info@lung.org">contact us</a> for more information. They are generally available free of charge to researchers and non-profit organizations. A fee may be charged for usage by for-profit&nbsp;companies.</p>
