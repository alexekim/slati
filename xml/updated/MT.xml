<Description>An employer may not refuse to employ or license and may not discriminate against an individual with respect to compensation, promotion, or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because the individual legally uses a lawful product off the employer’s premises during non-work hours.  This does not apply to use of a lawful product that affects in any manner an individual&apos;s ability to perform job-related employment responsibilities or the safety of other employees, or conflicts with a bona fide occupational qualification that is reasonably related to the individual&apos;s employment; an individual who, on a personal basis, has a professional service contract with an employer and the unique nature of the services provided authorizes the employer, as part of the service contract, to limit the use of certain products; or an employer that is a nonprofit organization that, as one of its primary purposes or objectives, discourages the use of one or more lawful products by the general public.  However, an employer may offer, impose, or have in effect a health, disability, or life insurance policy that makes distinctions between employees for the type or price of coverage based on the employees’ use of a product with stipulations.  The person against whom a violation is committed may file a civil action against an employer within one year of the alleged violation.  Prior to filing a civil action, an employee shall within 120 days of the alleged violation, initiate any internal grievance procedure available.  If a grievance procedure is not exhausted within 120 days, the employee may file a civil action.</Description>

<Citation>MONT. CODE ANN. §§ 17-6-601 to 17-6-603 (2007) &amp; MT CONSTITUTION Art. XII § 4 (2000).</Citation>
<Description>Statutory Initiative 146, approved by voters in November 2002, re-designated how Master Settlement Agreement payments would be spent: 32 percent is deposited in a state special revenue account and may only be used to fund state tobacco control programs; 17 percent is deposited in a state special revenue fund and is used to help fund the state Children&apos;s Health Insurance Program and programs of the Montana Comprehensive Health Association; 40 percent is dedicated to the Tobacco Trust Fund per the constitutional referendum in 2000 (see below); and the remaining 11 percent is deposited in the state general fund.  These allocations will apply to MSA payments received after June 30, 2003.  The legislature retained the authority to override these allocations.
MONT. CODE ANN. § 17-6-602 &amp; 17-6-606 (2007).

Referendum C-35 was passed by the voters of Montana in November 2000 to amend Article XII of the state constitution by adding a new section Four. It directs the legislature to dedicate not less than 40 percent of settlement proceeds received on or after January 1, 2001, to a trust fund, 90 percent of the interest and income of which may be appropriated.  Ten percent of the interest and income derived from the trust fund on or after January 1, 2001, shall be deposited in the trust fund.  The principal of the trust fund and 10 percent of the interest and income deposited in the trust fund shall remain forever inviolate unless appropriated by a vote of two-thirds of the members of each house of the legislature.  Appropriations of the interest, income, or principal from the trust fund shall be used only for tobacco disease prevention programs and state programs providing benefits, services, or coverage that are related to the health care needs of the people of Montana and may not be used for other purposes.  Appropriations of the interest, income, or principal from the trust fund shall not be used to replace state or federal money used to fund tobacco disease prevention programs and state programs that existed on December 31,1999 providing benefits, services, or coverage of the health care needs of the people of Montana.</Description>
