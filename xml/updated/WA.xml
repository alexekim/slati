<Description>Smoking is prohibited in virtually all public places, including restaurants, bars and non-tribal casinos. &quot;Public place&quot; is defined as that portion of any building or vehicle used by and open to the public, regardless of whether the building or vehicle is owned in whole or in part by private persons or entities, the state of Washington, or other public entity, and regardless of whether a fee is charged for admission. This includes a presumptively reasonable minimum distance of 25 feet from entrances, exits, windows that open and ventilation intakes that serve an enclosed area where smoking is prohibited. See statute citation for a specific list of what are classified as &quot;public places.&quot;

<Description>A public place does not include a private residence unless the private residence is used to provide licensed child care, foster care, adult care, or other similar social service care on the premises. This chapter is also not intended to restrict smoking in private facilities which are occasionally open to the public except upon the occasions when the facility is open to the public.
WASH. REV. CODE §§ 70.160.010 et seq. (2005).

<Citation>WASH. REV. CODE § 70.345.210 (2016).</Citation>
<Description>Stronger local laws/ordinances further restricting smoking are not allowed due to a court decision by the Washington Supreme Court and are limited in scope for vapor products (e-cigarettes and related products), see below.

The Washington Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the prohibition on smoking in almost all public places and workplaces in Pierce County, WA cannot go into effect because the ordinance prohibits what state statute specifically allows in this case prohibiting smoking where state law allows businesses to decide whether to allow smoking or not. This means that localities in Washington are preempted from enacting clean indoor air ordinances stronger than state law.
Entertainment Industry Coalition v. Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department et al., decided 2/10/05 (2005).

No political subdivision may regulate the use of vapor products in outdoor public places, unless the public place is an area where children congregate, such as schools, playgrounds, and parks. Subject to section 70.345.150 Revised Code of Washington, political subdivisions may regulate the use of vapor products in indoor public places.</Description>

<Description>Owners or the person in charge must post signs in a conspicuous place at the entrance to a public place prohibiting smoking.  Intentionally smoking in a &quot;public place&quot; or &quot;place of employment&quot; or removal or defacement of signs are punishable by a civil fine of up to $100. Any person passing by or through a public place while on a public sidewalk or public right of way has not intentionally violated this chapter. After an initial warning, violation by an owner or person in charge of a &quot;public place&quot; or &quot;place of employment&quot; is subject to up to a $100 civil fine each day the violation continues. Local law enforcement agencies enforce the law against individual smokers and local health departments enforce the law against owners or persons in charge of &quot;public places&quot; or &quot;places of employment.&quot; Owners, operators, managers, employers, or other persons who own or control a &quot;public place&quot; or &quot;place of employment&quot; may seek to rebut the presumption that 25 feet is a reasonable minimum distance by making application to the director of the local health department or district in which the &quot;public place&quot; or &quot;place of employment&quot; is located.</Description>

<Citation>WASH. REV. CODE § 70.345.090 (2016).</Citation>
<Description>A person may not ship or transport, or cause to be shipped or transported, any tobacco product ordered or purchased by mail or through the Internet to anyone in this state other than a licensed wholesaler or retailer; or with knowledge or reason to know of the violation, provide substantial assistance to a person who is in violation of these requirements. Violation is a Class C felony subject to a maximum fine of $5,000, a civil penalty of up to $5,000 may be imposed in lieu of or in addition to the criminal penalty. The attorney general may seek an injunction in superior court to restrain a threatened or actual violation and compel compliance. Any violation is also considered an unfair and deceptive act or practice and an unfair method of competition in the conduct of trade or commerce under Washington law.
WASH. REV. CODE § 70.155.140 (2009).

No person may conduct a delivery sale or otherwise ship or transport, or cause to be shipped or transported, any vapor product ordered or purchased by mail or through the Internet to any person unless such seller has a valid delivery sale license and is over the minimum legal age to purchase vapor products. A delivery sale licensee must: 1) not accept a purchase or order from any person without first obtaining the full name, birth date, and residential address of that person and verifying this information through an independently operated third-party database or aggregate of databases, which includes data from government sources; 2) accept payment only through a credit or debit card issued in the purchaser&apos;s own name and verify that the card is issued to the same person identified through the same identity and age verification procedures as above; 3) before first sale verify the identity and delivery address of the purchaser by mailing or shipping a notice of sale and certification form as specified or obtaining an electronic certification from the customer as specified; and 4) include on shipping documents a clear and conspicuous statement which includes, at a minimum, that the package contains vapor products, Washington law prohibits sales to those under the minimum age, and violations may result in sanctions to both the licensee and the purchaser. A person who knowingly violates this section is guilty of a class C felony, except that the maximum fine that may be imposed is $5,000. In addition to or in lieu of any other civil or criminal remedy provided by law, a person who has violated this section is subject to a civil penalty of up to $5,000 for each violation.</Description>

<Description>No person may engage in the business of sampling tobacco products. A violation of this section is a misdemeanor.
WASH. REV. CODE §§ 70.155.050 (2006)

Note: A 2006 federal district court decision found that federal law preempted the state law above in regards to cigarette sampling only.

No person shall give or distribute coupons for tobacco products if such coupon is redeemed in any manner that does not require an in-person transaction in a retail store. The penalty for licensees and all others is a fine of $2,000 for each violation.
WASH. REV. CODE §§ 70.155.070 (1993) &amp; 70.155.100 (2016).

No person may give or distribute vapor products to a person free of charge by coupon, unless the vapor product was provided to the person as a contingency of prior or the same purchase as part of an in-person transaction or delivery sale. This does not prohibit the use of coupons to receive a discount on a vapor product as part of an in-person transaction or delivery sale. Violation is subject to the same penalties as selling vapor products to persons under age 18.</Description>

<Description>No person shall sell or permit to be sold cigarettes not in the original unopened package to which the required stamp has been affixed.  This does not apply to the sale of loose leaf tobacco by a retail business that generates a minimum of 60 percent of annual gross sales from the sale of tobacco products.  Penalties assessed against the licensee by the Liquor Control Board for violation are the same as selling or giving tobacco products to minors.   Any person other than a licensee who commits a violation may be fined $100 for each offense.     
WASH. REV. CODE §§ 70.155.040 (1993) &amp; 70.155.100 (1998).

No stamp may be affixed to, or made upon, any container or package of cigarettes if the container or package differs in any respect with the requirements of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act for the placement of labels, warnings, or any other information upon a package of cigarettes that is to be sold within the United States.</Description>
