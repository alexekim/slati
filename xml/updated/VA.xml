The law also makes selling or possessing counterfeit cigarettes illegal, and prescribes penalties.

Violation by an individual or a separate retail establishment, except for the sale of bidis, shall be punishable by a civil penalty not to exceed $100 for the first violation, up to $200 for a second violation and up to $500 for subsequent violations.</Description>
