<Citation>MD. CODE ANN., HEALTH-GEN. § 24-305 (2015).</Citation>
<Description>A person engaged in selling or otherwise distributing tobacco products for commercial purposes may not distribute tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia to persons under 18 years of age.  No other person may purchase for, deliver or sell tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia to a minor.  This does not apply to the distribution of a tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia to a minor who is acting solely as the agent of the minor&apos;s employer if the employer distributes tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia for commercial purposes.  Persons who violate this law shall be subject to a fine of not more than $300 for the first violation, $1,000 for a second violation within two years, and $3,000 for subsequent violations within a two-year period.  It is a defense that the defendant examined the purchaser&apos;s or recipient&apos;s driver&apos;s license or other valid identification issued by an employer, government unit, or institution of higher education that positively identified the purchaser or recipient as at least 18 years of age.  The owner or person in control of a tobacco vending machine that has the required sign displayed is not subject to these penalties if a person under 18 has purchased tobacco from their machine.
MD. CODE ANN. CRIM. LAW § 10-107 (2007).

A person may not sell, distribute or offer for sale to a person under age 18 an electronic device that can used to deliver nicotine, including electronic cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and pipes. This restriction also includes components or products used to refill or resupply electronic devices. This does not apply to a nicotine device if it has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sale as a tobacco cessation product, and is being marketed and sold solely for that approved purpose. Violation is a civil penalty of $300 for a first violation and $500 for any subsequent violations after the first one within 24 months of violation. It is a defense to prosecution if the person examined the purchaser or recipient&apos;s drivers license or other valid ID issued by an employer, government unit or institution of higher education.</Description>

<Description>A person engaged in the business of selling or otherwise distributing tobacco products for commercial purposes may not give away, offer or dispense tobacco products, cigarette rolling papers or a coupon redeemable for any tobacco product to a minor.  This does not apply to the distribution of a coupon that is redeemable for a tobacco product, if the coupon is contained in a newspaper, magazine, or other type of publication in which the coupon is incidental to the primary purpose of the publication; or the coupon is sent through the mail.  This also does not apply to the distribution of a tobacco product to a minor who is acting solely as the agent of the minor&apos;s employer if the employer distributes tobacco products for commercial purposes.
