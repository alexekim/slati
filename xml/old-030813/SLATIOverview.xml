<IssueName>Youth Access</IssueName>
<IssueDescription>Age Restrictions on Sales of Tobacco Products: 
Federal regulations prohibit the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco (but not cigars or other tobacco products) to persons under age 18.  Retailers are required to verify a person’s age by photographic identification containing the person’s date of birth unless the person is over 26 years of age.

In addition, all 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the sale of tobacco products to minors.  Most states define minors as persons less than 18 years of age; however, four states - Alabama, Alaska, New Jersey and Utah - define minors as persons less than 19 years of age. Also:
	
* 39 states and the District of Columbia require retailers to post signs at or near the point of purchase stating that selling tobacco products to minors is illegal.  
* 20 states and the District of Columbia require a person/retail store selling tobacco products to check the identification of a purchaser who appears to be under a certain age.
	
	Minor Purchase/Possession/Use of Tobacco Products:
Forty-five states and the District of Columbia penalize minors for tobacco sales-related offenses.  Of these states, 38 states and the District of Columbia prohibit minors from possessing and/or using tobacco products.  Penalties for violation often include a fine and/or alternative penalties like performing community service, attending smoking education/cessation programs and/or suspension of a driver’s license or learner’s permit.   
	
Note: Penalizing children has not been proven to be an effective technique to reduce underage tobacco usage.  In fact, penalties may adversely affect existing programs that are proven to be effective and are required, such as compliance checks utilizing young people.
	
	Placement of Tobacco Products: 
Federal regulations require retailers to sell cigarettes and smokeless tobacco (but not cigars and other tobacco products) only in a direct, face-to-face exchange between the retailer and consumer.  This means self-service displays of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are prohibited except in facilities where the retailer ensures that no person younger than 18 is permitted to enter at any time. 
	
	In addition, 27 states - Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Wyoming - and the District of Columbia have state laws restricting customer access to cigarettes and/or tobacco products in retail stores.
	  
* Sixteen of these states - Alabama, Alaska, California, Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming - completely prohibit customers from having direct access to all tobacco products in retail stores, and/or have language prohibiting the use of self-service displays.

State Preemption of Local Laws:
Eighteen states partially or totally prevent (preempt) local communities from passing stronger local laws/ordinances concerning the youth access laws discussed above.  In the case of three additional states – California, Massachusetts and Missouri – limited preemption exists for small areas of these youth access laws.</IssueDescription>

In addition, 31 states and the District of Columbia prohibit selling cigarettes in packs of less than 20 and/or as single cigarettes.  Of those:
	
* 11 states – Alabama, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia - and the District of Columbia explicitly prohibit cigarette sales in packs of less than 20 and as single cigarettes.
* 13 states – Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Kentucky, New York, North Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Utah - prohibit cigarettes sales in packs of less than 20, but do not include language prohibiting sales of single cigarettes.
* 7 states - Arkansas, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania - prohibit sales of single cigarettes, but do not include language prohibiting cigarette sales in packs of less than 20.
	
	In addition, among all 50 states and the District of Columbia:

	          *14 states make only cigarettes subject to this requirement.

State Preemption of Local Laws:

In the case of California, limited preemption exists concerning penalties for violation of certain state youth access laws.</IssueDescription>

In addition, 48 states and the District of Columbia have laws restricting the placement of tobacco product vending machines; only New Hampshire and New Jersey do not.  
	
	* Idaho and Vermont completely prohibit the sale of tobacco products through vending machines.  
* 19 states prohibit tobacco vending machines everywhere except for bars, taverns and other places where minors are not permitted by law.

<IssueName>Advertising and Promotion</IssueName>

<IssueName>Use of Settlement Dollars</IssueName>
<IssueDescription>Forty-six states and the District of Columbia receive annual payments from certain cigarette companies as part of the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA), a lawsuit settlement signed in 1998 between Attorneys General in those states and the companies.
