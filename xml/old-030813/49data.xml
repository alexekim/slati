<Description>Smoking and Rental Agreements/Leases:
Allows for a prohibition on smoking in a rental agreement or lease.
UTAH CODE ANN. § 57-22-5 (1)(h) (1997).

Smoking and Condominium Associations:
Gives condominium associations the authority to restrict smoking in units, common areas and facilities.  Common areas include yard space.
UTAH CODE ANN. § 57-8-16 (7) (1997).

Secondhand Smoke Considered a Nuisance Legally:
Secondhand smoke is defined as a nuisance when it drifts into any residential unit a person rents, leases, or owns, from another residential or commercial unit more than once in each of two or more consecutive seven-day periods, and which is injurious to health, indecent, offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property.  A nuisance may be the subject of an action.  This does not apply to residential rental units available for temporary rental or hotel or motel rooms.  The cause of action is waived if the rental agreement explicitly says tobacco smoke may drift into the apartment.</Description>

Year first enacted: 1923
UTAH CODE ANN. § 59-14-204 (2010).

In addition to the cigarette tax above, there is imposed an equity assessment of 35 cents per pack of 20 cigarettes on tobacco product manufacturers not participating in the Master Settlement Agreement.  The purposes of this equity assessment are: to recover health care costs to the state imposed by nonparticipating manufacturers;  to prevent nonparticipating manufacturers from undermining the state&apos;s policy of reducing underage smoking by offering cigarettes for sale substantially below the prices of cigarettes of other manufacturers;  to protect funding, which is reduced as a result of the growth of nonparticipating manufacturer cigarette sales, for programs funded in whole or in part by payments to the state under the Master Settlement Agreement; to recoup settlement-payment revenue lost to the state as a result of nonparticipating manufacturer cigarette sales; and to fund enforcement and administration of Master Settlement Agreement provisions.</Description>

<Citation>UTAH CODE ANN. § 76-10-105.3 (2002).</Citation>
<Description>Any person who knowingly, intentionally, recklessly, or with criminal negligence provides any cigar, cigarette, electronic cigarette or tobacco in any form, to any person under 19 years of age, is guilty of a class C misdemeanor on the first offense, a class B misdemeanor on the second offense, and a class A misdemeanor on subsequent offenses.
UTAH CODE ANN. § 76-10-104 (2010).

If, following an investigation or issuance of a citation or information, an enforcing agency (the state Department of Health and/or local health departments) determines that a licensee or any employee has sold tobacco to a person younger than 19 years of age, the enforcing agency may impose upon the licensee the following administrative penalties: not more than $300 for a first violation; not more than $750 for a second violation within 12 months; and $1,000 for a third and subsequent violations within a 12-month period.  A licensee is also subject to a license suspension for not more than 30 days for a third violation and license revocation for one year after a specified date for a fourth and subsequent violation.  In determining the amount of the monetary penalty to be imposed for an employee&apos;s violation the hearing officer shall reduce the penalty by at least 50 percent if they determine the licensee has implemented a documented employee training program, and the employee has completed that training program within 30 days of commencing duties of selling tobacco products.  If the hearing officer determines regarding a first offense at a location, that the licensee has not implemented a documented training program with a written curriculum for employees at that location regarding compliance with this chapter, the hearing officer may suspend all or a portion of the monetary penalty, contingent upon the licensee&apos;s initiating a training program for employees at that location within 30 days after the hearing date.  If the training program is not implemented, the penalty shall be promptly imposed. 
UTAH CODE ANN. §§ 26-42-103 (2011) &amp; 26-42-106 (1998).

<Description>Mail-order sales of cigarettes and tobacco products are exempt from the face-to-face sale requirement in section 76-10-105.1 of the Utah Code.  However, a person, distributor, manufacturer, or retailer shall not: 1) cause tobacco products or cigarettes as defined to be ordered or purchased by anyone other than a person who is licensed by the state Tax Commission to manufacture, import, distribute, barter, sell, exchange, or offer cigarettes for sale; or 2) knowingly provide substantial assistance to a person who violates this requirement.  Violation is subject to a civil penalty of $5,000 for each violation, an injunction to restrain a threatened or actual violation and recovery by the state of the costs to prosecute the case as specified.  A person who knowingly violates this section has engaged in an unfair and deceptive trade practice under existing Utah law, and the court shall order any profits, gain, gross receipts, or other benefit from the violation to be disgorged.</Description>

<Description>It is a class B misdemeanor for any person to display on any billboard, streetcar sign, streetcar, bus, placard or on any other object or place of display, any advertisement of any tobacco product, except that a dealer in tobacco products may have a sign on the front of his place of business stating that he deals in the articles.  This law does not prohibit advertisements of tobacco products in any newspaper, magazine, or other periodical in the state.  
UTAH CODE ANN. §§ 76-10-102 (1986).

Note #1:Enforcement of the above provisions may be affected by the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Lorillard Tobacco Company v. Reilly, decided in 2001.

Note #2: Section 76-10-102 of the Utah Code also required warnings on newspaper, magazine or periodical advertisements for smokeless tobacco products.  However, the language of this provision defers to any subsequently enacted federal law for the specific warning language required to be placed in smokeless tobacco advertisements.  Shortly thereafter, the federal Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 was enacted and said that no other statement relating to the use of smokeless tobacco products and health shall be required by any state or local statute or regulation to be included on any package or in any advertisement (unless the advertisement is an outdoor billboard advertisement) of a smokeless tobacco product.

<Description>Utah created the &quot;Tobacco Settlement Restricted Account,&quot; a restricted account in the general fund. The account shall consist of 60 percent of all funds received from the MSA on and after July 1, 2007.  Funds will be appropriated from this account in the following order: $10,452,900 for the children&apos;s health insurance program, $3,487,100 for alcohol, tobacco, and other drug prevention, reduction, cessation, and control programs; $2,519,100 to the Administrative Office of the Courts and the Department of Human Services for statewide expansion of the drug court program; $4 million to the University of Utah Health Sciences Center; and any remaining funds as directed by the legislature.   
UTAH CODE ANN. § 51-9-201 (2010).

Utah created a Permanent State Trust Fund under Utah Constitution Article XXII, Section Four to receive a portion of the annual payments from the Master Settlement Agreement.  The principal of the trust fund is invested in perpetuity, and can be transferred to the General Fund only by a vote of three-quarters of both houses of the legislature and concurrence by the governor.  The interest income from the trust fund is transferred to the general fund where by statute 50 percent is returned to the permanent trust fund.  The trust fund no longer receives an allocation from the annual MSA payment on and after July 1, 2011, and the remaining 40 percent of the MSA payment is allocated to the state general fund.</Description>
