<Citation>N.D. CENT. CODE § 54-27-25(2) (2008).</Citation>
<Description>On November 4, 2008, North Dakota voters approved, 54 to 46 percent, a ballot initiative (Measure 3) dedicating additional money from the MSA the state began receiving in 2008 to a comprehensive tobacco control program to be funded at or above the $9.3 million level recommended by CDC through a Tobacco Prevention and Control Advisory Committee.
North Dakota Ballot Measure 3, approved by voters 11/4/08 and effective 12/08.

There is created in the state treasury a tobacco settlement trust fund where all MSA dollars, except MSA strategic contribution payments received from 2008 to 2017, are deposited.  Interest earned from money in the trust fund is deposited in the trust fund.  The principal and interest from the fund must be allocated as follows: 1) 10 percent of annual transfers to a community health trust fund administered by the state health department, a minimum of 80 percent of which must be used for tobacco prevention and control programs; 2) 45 percent of annual transfers to the common schools trust fund to become part of the principal of that fund; and 3) 45 percent of annual transfers to the water development trust fund to address the long-term water development needs of the state.
N.D. CENT. CODE § 54-27-25(1) (2008).

There is created in the state treasury the Tobacco Prevention and Control Trust Fund where MSA strategic contribution payments received from 2008 to 2017 are deposited.  Interest earned from money in the trust fund is deposited in the trust fund.  Moneys in the fund are administered by the executive committee of the Tobacco Prevention and Control Advisory Committee for the purpose of creating and implementing a comprehensive plan to reduce tobacco use in North Dakota based on CDC Best Practices for Comprehensive Tobacco Control Programs.  The comprehensive plan can not duplicate the work of the community health grant program established under North Dakota Century Code section 23.38 et. seq. If in any biennium, the tobacco prevention and control trust fund does not have adequate dollars to fund a comprehensive plan, the treasurer shall transfer money from the water development trust fund to the tobacco prevention and control trust fund in an amount equal to the amount determined necessary by the executive committee.</Description>
