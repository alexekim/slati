<Citation>IND. CODE §§ 35-46-1-10 (2003) &amp; 7.1-3-18.5-8 (2008).</Citation>
<Description>A retail establishment that sells or distributes tobacco, the definition of which includes dissolvable tobacco products, to a minor commits a Class C infraction.  For a sale to take place the buyer must pay the seller for the tobacco products.  Violation is subject to civil penalties ranging from up to $200 if an establishment has received no citations/summons in the previous 180 days to up to $1,000 if an establishment has been issued three or more citations/summonses in the previous 180 days.   A person who violates this law at least six times in any 180-day period commits habitual illegal sale of tobacco, a Class B infraction, and the tobacco sales certificate may be suspended by the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission.  The commission may mitigate civil penalties against a certificate holder if they have a training program for their employees that cover specific topics.  It is not a defense that the person to whom the tobacco was sold or distributed did not smoke, chew, or otherwise consume the tobacco.  It is a defense if the buyer produced a driver&apos;s license or photo ID that showed the buyer was of legal age to make the purchase; and the appearance of the purchaser or recipient was such that an ordinary prudent person would believe that the purchaser or recipient was not less than the legal age.  It is also a defense if the accused retail establishment sold or delivered the tobacco to a person who acted in the ordinary course of employment or a business concerning tobacco: agriculture, processing, transporting, wholesaling, or retailing.  Unless a person buys or receives tobacco under the direction of a law enforcement officer as part of an enforcement action, a person who sells or distributes tobacco is not liable for a violation of this section unless the person less than 18 years of age who bought or received the tobacco is also issued a citation or summons.    
IND. CODE §§ 35-46-1-10.2 (2008) &amp; 7.1-3-18.5-8 (2008).

A person who knowingly sells or distributes tobacco, the definiton of which includes dissolvable tobacco products, to a minor or purchases tobacco for delivery to another person who is a minor commits a Class C infraction punishable by a fine of up to $500.  For a sale to take place the buyer must pay the seller for the tobacco products.  It is not a defense that the person to whom the tobacco was sold or distributed did not smoke, chew, or otherwise consume the tobacco.  The same affirmative defenses available to retailers are also available to persons who sell tobacco products to minors (see above).  Unless a person buys or receives tobacco under the direction of a law enforcement officer as part of an enforcement action, a person who sells or distributes tobacco is not liable for a violation of this section unless the person less than 18 years of age who bought or received the tobacco is also issued a citation or summons.</Description>

<Description>The owner of a retail establishment that sells or distributes tobacco through a self-service display, other than a coin operated machine, commits a Class C infraction.  As used in this section, &quot;self-service display&quot; means a display that contains tobacco in an area where a customer is permitted and has access to tobacco without assistance from a sales person.  This does not apply to a self-service display in a retail establishment that has a primary purpose to sell tobacco and prohibits entry by persons less than 18 years of age.</Description>

<Description>A merchant may not mail or ship cigarettes as part of a delivery sale unless, before mailing or shipping the cigarettes, the merchant: obtains from the prospective customer a written statement signed by the prospective customer stating the customer&apos;s address and date of birth, makes a good faith effort to verify the information by using a federal or commercially available data base and receives payment for the delivery sale by a credit or debit card issued in the name of the prospective purchaser.  Merchants that are not cigarette manufacturers are prohibited from making delivery sales to Indiana residents or retailers that are not distributors except under specified circumstances.  Violation is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000.  A merchant who mails or ships cigarettes as part of a delivery sale shall use a mailing or shipping service that requires the customer or a person at least 18 years of age designated by the customer to sign to accept delivery of the cigarettes; and to present a valid driver&apos;s license or identification card unless the person appears to be over 27 years of age.  Violation by a delivery service is up to a $1,000 fine.  Violations by merchants range from $1,000 to $2,000 for a first violation to $10,000 for a fifth violation in five years.  Signing another person&apos;s name to a certification is a $1,000 fine.
