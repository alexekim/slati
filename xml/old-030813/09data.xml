<Description>Any person employed by a dealer or distributor who sells, gives, or delivers tobacco in any form to a minor, other than a minor who is delivering or accepting delivery in their capacity as an employee, shall be assessed a civil penalty by the Commissioner of Revenue Services of not more than $200 for the first offense and $250 for subsequent offenses within 18 months.  Any dealer or distributor who has sold, given or delivered cigarettes or tobacco products to a minor, other than a minor who is delivering or accepting delivery in their capacity as an employee, or if their employee has done so, shall be assessed a civil penalty of $350 for the first violation, $750 for the second violation within 18 months, and a fine of $750 and license suspension for at least 30 days for the third offense within 18 months.   
CONN. GEN. STAT. § 12-295a(b&amp;c) (2007).

If the owner of an establishment where a cigarette vending machine is located has sold, given or delivered or allowed to be sold, given or delivered tobacco products to a minor, other than a minor who is delivering or accepting delivery in their capacity as an employee, from that machine, they are subject to the same civil penalties as dealers of tobacco products above, except on a third violation within 18 months, the vending machine will be immediately removed from the establishment, and may not be placed there again for a period of one year.
CONN. GEN. STAT. § 12-295a(d) (2007).

Any person who sells, gives, or delivers tobacco to a minor shall be fined not more than $200 for the first offense, $350 for a second offense within 18 months, and not more than $500 for each subsequent offense within 18 months.  A seller or seller&apos;s agent or employee may perform a transaction scan to check the validity of a driver&apos;s license or identity card presented by a cardholder as a condition for selling, giving away, or otherwise distributing tobacco to the cardholder.  It is an affirmative defense to prosecution if all the following occurred: A card holder attempting to purchase tobacco products presented an official piece of identification; a transaction scan of the ID indicated that it was valid; tobacco products were sold or given away in reasonable reliance upon the ID presented and the completed scan. However, this does not excuse the seller from exercising reasonable diligence to determine whether the person attempting to purchase tobacco products is 18 years of age or older and whether the description and picture appearing on the ID presented by a card holder is that of the card holder.</Description>
