<Description>Taxes and fees per pack of 20: $1.586  
Date last changed: August 1, 2011 -- from $1.576 to $1.586  
Year first enacted: 1947
MINN. STAT. §§ 297F.05 (1992) &amp; 256.9658 (2005).

A special tax is imposed on distributors on the sale of cigarettes by a cigarette distributor to a retailer or cigarette sub-jobber for resale in Minnesota.  This tax must be determined annually by November 1 and takes effect on January 1 except as specified for the time period August 2011 to December 2011.   
MINN. STAT. § 297F.25 (2011).

Note: The tax above was adjusted on August 1, 2011 as noted above prior to changing the date for adjustment to January 1, so the effective combined tax/fee on cigarettes increased from $1.576 to $1.586 per pack.

A fee of 35 cents per pack is imposed upon the sale of nonsettlement cigarettes in this state.  The purpose of this fee is to ensure that manufacturers of nonsettlement cigarettes pay fees to the state that are comparable to costs attributable to the use of the cigarettes; prevent manufacturers of nonsettlement cigarettes from undermining the state&apos;s policy of discouraging underage smoking by offering nonsettlement cigarettes at prices substantially below the cigarettes of other manufacturers; and fund such other purposes as the legislature determines appropriate.</Description>

<Description>Anyone who sells tobacco to a person under the age of 18 years is guilty of a misdemeanor for the first violation, and a gross misdemeanor for subsequent violations within five years.  It is an affirmative defense to the charge of selling tobacco to a minor, if the person relied in good faith upon specified proof of age.  Whoever furnishes tobacco or tobacco-related devices to a minor is guilty of a misdemeanor for the first violation and a gross misdemeanor for any subsequent violation.  However, an Indian may furnish tobacco to an Indian minor as part of a traditional Indian spiritual or cultural ceremony.
MINN. STAT. § 609.685 (2010).

If a municipal licensee or employee of a municipal licensee sells tobacco or tobacco-related devices to a minor the licensee shall be charged an administrative penalty of $75.  A second violation within 24 months after the initial violation is subject to an administrative penalty of $200.  A third violation within 24 months is subject to an administrative penalty of $250 and the license to sell tobacco products must be suspended for not less than seven days.  An individual who sells tobacco or tobacco-related devices to a person under the age of 18 must be charged an administrative penalty of $50.  The penalty and license suspension cannot take effect until the alleged violator has had the opportunity for a court hearing.  It is an affirmative defense to the charge of selling tobacco or tobacco-related devices to a minor, if the person relied in good faith upon specified proof of age.</Description>

<Description>A person under the age of 18 years who purchases or attempts to purchase tobacco or tobacco-related devices and who uses a driver&apos;s license, permit, Minnesota identification card, or any type of false identification to misrepresent the person&apos;s age, is guilty of a misdemeanor.  Except as otherwise stated above, any minor that possesses, smokes, chews, or otherwise ingests, purchases, or attempts to purchase tobacco or tobacco-related devices is guilty of a petty misdemeanor.  The penalties in this section do not apply to a person under the age of 18 years who purchases or attempts to purchase tobacco or tobacco-related devices while under the direct supervision of a responsible adult for training, education, research, or enforcement purposes.  
MINN. STAT. § 609.685 (2010).

A minor found guilty of using a driver&apos;s license or other form of identification to purchase or attempt to purchase tobacco products, or of lending to another minor their driver&apos;s license to purchase tobacco products shall have their driver&apos;s license suspended for 90 days.  
MINN. STAT. § 171.171 (2000). 

A county or municipal licensing authority shall consult with interested educators, parents, children, and representatives of the court system to develop alternative penalties for minors who purchase, possess, and consume tobacco or tobacco-related devices.  The licensing authority and the interested persons shall consider a variety of options, including, but not limited to, tobacco free education programs, notice to schools, parents, community service, and other court diversion programs. 
MINN. STAT. § 461.12(4) (2010).

A retailer of tobacco products may seize a form of identification listed in subsection 6 of section 340A.503 Minnesota Statutes, if the retailer has reasonable grounds to believe that the form of identification has been altered or falsified or is being used to violate any law.  A retailer that seizes a form of identification as authorized under this paragraph must deliver it to a law enforcement agency within 24 hours of seizing it.</Description>

<Description>An employer may not refuse to hire a job applicant or discipline or discharge an employee because the applicant or employee engages in or has engaged in the use or enjoyment of lawful consumable products, including tobacco, off the premises of the employer during non-work hours.  It is not a violation for an employer to restrict the use of lawful consumable products by employees during nonworking hours if the employer&apos;s restriction relates to a bona fide occupational requirement and is reasonably related to employment activities or responsibilities of a particular employee or group of employees; or is necessary to avoid a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest with any responsibilities owed by the employee to the employer.  It is also not a violation for an employer to refuse to hire an applicant or discipline or discharge an employee who refuses or fails to comply with the conditions established by a chemical dependency treatment or aftercare program; for an employer to offer, impose, or have in effect a health or life insurance plan that makes distinctions between employees for the type of coverage or the cost of coverage based upon the employee&apos;s use of lawful consumable products, provided that, to the extent that different premium rates are charged to the employees, those rates must reflect the actual differential cost to the employer; and for an employer to refuse to hire an applicant or discipline or discharge an employee on the basis of the applicant&apos;s or employee&apos;s past or present job performance.  The remedy for a violation is a civil action for damages limited to wages and benefits lost by the individual because of the violation.</Description>

<Description>In 1998, Lawrence D. Cohen, chief judge of the Ramsey County District Court, approved the state of Minnesota&apos;s plan to establish the Minnesota Partnership for Action Against Tobacco (MPAAT), a nonprofit foundation which will receive $202 million dollars (about 3 percent of Minnesota&apos;s settlement money) over ten years to fund projects that seek to reduce tobacco use in the state.  MPAAT, now called ClearWay Minnesota, serves Minnesota through its grant-making program, QUITPLAN individual stop-smoking services and community outreach, which includes an advertising campaign.  The organization files an annual report with the Ramsey County District Court and the state legislature each year.
State of Minnesota and Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Minnesota v. Philip Morris et al. (1998).

Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Minnesota, a co-plaintiff in Minnesota&apos;s settlement with the tobacco companies, is scheduled to receive $469 million total from the settlement subject to certain adjustments.  Due to these adjustments the actual amount received will be reduced.  The organization will be spending $252 million of this money over ten years to help reduce tobacco use, heart disease, and cancer in Minnesota.

<Description>In 1999, the legislature set a goal to reduce tobacco use among youth by 25 percent by the year 2005, and to promote statewide and local tobacco use prevention activities to help achieve this goal.  The Commissioner of Health, in consultation with other public, private, or nonprofit organizations involved in tobacco use prevention efforts, is required to establish measurable outcomes to determine the effectiveness of the grants receiving funds under this section in reducing the use of tobacco among youth, and a statewide assessment of tobacco-related behaviors and attitudes among youth to establish a baseline to measure the statewide effect of tobacco use prevention activities. The commissioner must also set up a grant program through the state Department of Health for statewide and local tobacco prevention grants to reduce tobacco use among youth, as well as local public health promotion and protection to local community health boards.  The legislature also required a biennial evaluation of these grant programs.</Description>

<Description>The Commissioner of Management and Budget may sell and issue debt under either or both of sections 16A.95 (tobacco securitization bonds) and 16A.96 (appropriations bonds), but the net proceeds of bonds issued and sold under those sections together must not exceed $640 million during fiscal years 2012 and 2013.
MINN. STAT. § 16A.94 (2011).

During fiscal years 2012 and 2013 , the Commissioner of Management and Budget may sell, convey, or otherwise transfer to the Tobacco Securitization Authority the tobacco settlement revenues in exchange for the net proceeds of bonds and a right to the residual amount in the tobacco settlement revenues subaccount.  The authority shall have power and is hereby authorized to issue bonds from time to time in one or more series, in an aggregate principal amount no greater than $900 million, excluding refunding bonds sold and issued under this section, to provide funds not to exceed $640 million and subject to the limitation in Minnesota Statutes section 16A.94, for the purchase of all or a portion of the tobacco settlement revenues.  The authority shall establish the Tobacco Settlement Recovery Account, with several sub-accounts, and monies in those accounts are transferred or distributed as specified.  The powers, duties and legal existence of the Tobacco Securitization Authority are also outlined in this statute.
MINN. STAT. § 16A.95 (2011).  

The Commissioner of Management and Budget may also sell and issue appropriation bonds of the state for public purposes as provided by law. Proceeds of the bonds must be credited to a special appropriation bond proceeds fund in the state treasury. Net income from investment of the proceeds, as estimated by the commissioner, must be credited to the special appropriation bond proceeds fund.  Appropriation bonds may be sold and issued in amounts that, in the opinion of the commissioner, are necessary to provide sufficient funds, not to exceed $640 million and subject to the limitation in section 16A.94 Minnesota Statutes, for achieving specified purposes provided, however, that bonds issued and unpaid shall not exceed $800 million in principal amount, excluding refunding bonds sold and issued under subdivision 4 of this section.  The statute also outlines other requirements concerning appropriations bonds, including validation by the state Supreme Court.
