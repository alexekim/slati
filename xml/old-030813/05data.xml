<Description>Smoking is prohibited in public places, the definition of which includes health care facilities.  &quot;Health care facility&quot; is defined as an office or institution providing care or treatment of diseases, whether physical, mental or emotional, or other medical, physiological or psychological conditions, including weight control clinics, homes for the chronically ill, laboratories, and offices of surgeons, chiropractors, physical therapists, physicians, dentists and all specialists within these professions.  This includes the building or buildings in which a medical facility operates, together with all property owned or operated by a medical facility that is contiguous to the building or buildings in which medical services are provided.  Health care facility does not include medical facilities as defined below, psychiatric hospitals or long-term care facilities.
ARK. CODE ANN. §§ 20-27-1803 &amp; 20-27-1804 (2006).

Psychiatric hospitals are exempt.  If a treating physician determines that an inpatient&apos;s treatment will be substantially impaired by the denial to that patient of the use of tobacco, the physician may enter a written order permitting the use of tobacco by that patient.  The order shall be consistent with the medical facilities staff bylaws, hospital regulations and any local ordinances.  Violation is a Class C misdemeanor.  Each medical facility shall post signs in prominent places in its facilities and on its property to explain the prohibition of smoking.</Description>

<Description>It is unlawful for any person to give, barter or sell tobacco products or cigarette papers to a minor less than 18 years of age.  A person who violates the above is subject to a fine of not more than $100 per violation.  An employee of an Arkansas retail cigarette and tobacco permit holder in violation is subject to a fine of not more than $100.  A retail permit holder or license holder is subject to penalties as specified in the paragraph below. 
ARK. CODE ANN. § 5-27-227(a&amp;i) (2009).

The Arkansas Tobacco Control Board may assess penalties for selling tobacco products to minors or other youth access laws as follows: 1) after receipt of a notice from the Board or other enforcing agency as specified, a civil penalty not to exceed $250 for a first violation within a 48-month period; 2) a civil penalty not to exceed $500, and  suspension of the permit or license to sell tobacco products for not more than two days for a second violation within a 48-month period; 3) a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 and suspension of the permit or license to sell tobacco products for not more than seven days for a third violation in a 48-month period; 4) a civil penalty not to exceed $2,000 and suspension of the license or permit to sell tobacco products for a period not to exceed 14 days for a fourth or subsequent violations in a 48-month period; and after five or more violations within a 48 month period, a license or permit may be revoked in addition to any civil penalties.  The court shall consider specific factors when reviewing a possible violation, including whether the business has adopted a written policy prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors and has taken other specified actions to reduce illegal tobacco sales.  An affirmative defense is available for a retailer or employee of a retailer if they reasonably relied on proof of age when making the sale.
ARK. CODE ANN. § 26-57-256(d-k) (2009).

A person who sells tobacco in any form or a cigarette paper may deny the sale of tobacco in any form or a cigarette paper to any person.</Description>

<Description>It is unlawful for a minor to use, possess, purchase or attempt to purchase tobacco in any form or cigarette papers.  It is also unlawful to use falsified identification or someone else&apos;s identification for the purpose of obtaining or attempting to obtain tobacco products or cigarette papers.  This does not apply if the minor is acting as an agent of a retail permit holder within the scope of employment.  This also does not prohibit minors from participating in compliance checks as specified, provided parental consent is obtained.  A tobacco product found in possession of a person under 18 may be confiscated by a certified law enforcement officer or a school official and immediately destroyed.  A minor found in violation of any state law and also found to be in possession of a tobacco product may be ordered by the court to perform up to three hours of community service and to enroll in a tobacco education program, in addition to any other punishment.

<Description>Initiated Act 1 was passed in November 2000 by the voters of Arkansas, which created a fund, held separate from the state Treasury, known as the Tobacco Settlement Cash Holding Fund, to be administered by the state Board of Finance. All monies received as part of the Master Settlement Agreement were directed to this fund. Beginning in 2002, tobacco settlement payments shall be distributed as follows: the first $5 million received in each calendar year shall be transferred to the Tobacco Settlement Debt Service Fund; and the amounts remaining shall be transferred to the Tobacco Settlement Program Fund.  The funds in the Tobacco Settlement Program Fund will then be distributed as follows:  31.6 percent will go to the Prevention and Cessation program account to fund tobacco prevention and cessation programs administered by the Arkansas Department of Health, 15.8 percent to the Targeted State Needs program account, 22.8 percent to the Arkansas Biosciences Institute program account and 29.8 percent to the Medicaid Expansion program account.</Description>
