<Description>Except as specified below, stronger local laws/ordinances further restricting smoking are not allowed.

The Tennessee General Assembly intends with the above law and other provisions of the Tennessee Code to preempt the entire field of legislation concerning the regulation of tobacco products.  Any law or regulation of tobacco products enacted or promulgated after March 15, 1994, by any agency or political subdivision of the state or any agency thereof is void; provided, that cities, counties and counties having a metropolitan form of government may regulate the use of tobacco products in buildings owned or leased by the political subdivision.  They may also prohibit smoking on the grounds of a hospital or in the public areas immediately outside of a hospital building and its entrances, including public sidewalks.  Smoking may be prohibited within up to 50 feet of a hospital&apos;s entrance or further distance as specified.  Also, airport authorities created pursuant to the provisions of title 42; utility districts created pursuant to the provisions of title 7; and special school districts may regulate the use of tobacco products in buildings owned or leased by those entities.</Description>

<Description>It is unlawful for any person to sell or distribute any tobacco product or e-cigarette to another person who is less than 18 or to purchase a tobacco product on behalf of such person.  It is unlawful for any person to persuade, entice, send or assist a person who is less than 18 years of age to purchase, acquire, receive or attempt to purchase, acquire or receive a tobacco product.  This shall not be deemed to preclude law enforcement efforts involving the use of individuals less than 18 years of age.  A person who violates these provisions shall receive a warning letter for the first violation, a civil penalty of not more than $500 for a second violation, not more than $1,000 for a third violation and not more than $1,500 for a fourth or subsequent violation within a five-year period.  A person who demanded, was shown, and reasonably relied upon proof of age shall not be liable for a civil penalty for a violation.  When assessing a civil penalty, the Commissioner of Agriculture is authorized to assess the penalty against any person or persons determined by the commissioner to be responsible, in whole or in part, for contributing to or causing the violation to occur, including, but not limited to, the owner, manager or employee of a store at which tobacco products are sold at retail.  Before selling tobacco products, all employees are required to undergo training regarding state law restricting youth access to tobacco products and sign a statement to this effect.  That statement can be used by the owner or manager as an affirmative defense against the civil penalty for a second violation, and may be used as a mitigating factor for subsequent violations.</Description>

A violation is a civil offense with a penalty of not less than $10 and not more than $50.  The juvenile court may also impose community service work not to exceed 50 hours or successful completion of a prescribed teen court program for a second or subsequent violation within a one-year period.  A minor assisting a law enforcement officer in a compliance check is not subject to these penalties.  It is not unlawful for a person under 18 years of age to handle or transport tobacco or tobacco products as a part of and in the course of such person&apos;s employment, provided that the person is under the supervision of another employee who is at least 21 years of age.</Description>
