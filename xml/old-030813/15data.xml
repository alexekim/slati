<Description>It is unlawful to ship cigarettes to a person or entity that is not: 1) licensed to sell or possess tobacco products by the state, 2) an export warehouse proprietor or 3) an operator of a customs-bonded warehouse.  This does not apply if the cigarettes are exempt from taxes, all applicable Hawaii taxes are paid, or the person or entity has fully complied with the federal Jenkins Act and includes a specified notice on the shipping container.  Violation is a Class C felony if 1,000 or more cigarettes are shipped illegally, and a misdemeanor if less than 1,000 cigarettes are shipped illegally.  A delivery service is exempt if it is not a knowing participant in violating this law.  Other tobacco products are excluded from these requirements.

<Description>It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in the business of a wholesaler or dealer in the state without having received a license issued by the Department of Taxation; provided that this section shall not be construed to supersede any other law relating to licensing of persons in the same business. The license shall be renewable annually on July 1st for the 12 months ending the succeeding June 30th.  The license may be suspended, revoked or not renewed by the department for specified reasons.
HAW. REV. STAT. § 245-2 (2005).

Every retailer engaged in the retail sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products shall obtain a retail tobacco permit.  Permits shall be valid for one year, from December 1 to November 30, and renewable annually.  A separate retail tobacco permit shall be obtained for each place of business owned, controlled, or operated by a retailer.  A retail tobacco permit shall be non-assignable and nontransferable from one entity to another, and shall be displayed at all times in a conspicuous place at the place of business.

<Description>In civil litigation under any legal theory involving a signatory, a successor of a signatory, or an affiliate of a signatory to the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA), the supersedeas bond to be furnished to stay the execution of the judgment during the entire course of appellate review shall be set in accordance with applicable laws or court rules, except that the total bond that is required of all appellants collectively shall not exceed $150 million, regardless of the amount of the judgment.  If an appellee proves by a preponderance of the evidence that an appellant is dissipating assets outside the ordinary course of business to avoid the payment of a judgment, a court may require the appellant to post a bond in an amount up to the full amount of the judgment.
HAW. REV. STAT. § 328L-7 (2004).

In any civil action brought under any legal theory, the amount of a supersedeas bond or other form of security necessary to stay execution of a judgment granting legal, equitable, or any other form of relief during the entire course of all appeals or discretionary review of that judgment by all appellate courts shall be set in accordance with applicable law, except that the total amount of the supersedeas bond or other form of security that is required of any party shall not exceed $25 million regardless of the amount of the judgment that is appealed.  If the party posting the bond is a &quot;small business concern,&quot; the required supersedeas bond is capped at $1 million.  If a party in whose favor the judgment has been entered proves to a court by a preponderance of the evidence that an appellant who has posted a supersedeas bond is intentionally dissipating assets outside the ordinary course of its business for the purpose of avoiding payment of the judgment, a court may require the appellant to post a supersedeas bond in an amount up to the total amount of the judgment appealed.  This statute does not apply to MSA signatories, which are covered by a separate, existing statute (see above).</Description>
