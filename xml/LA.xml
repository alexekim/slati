<Description>Louisiana established the Millennium Trust, a permanent trust fund in the state treasury.  After allocation of money to the Bond Security and Redemption Fund, a portion of the proceeds not sold to the Tobacco Settlement Financing Corporation from the Master Settlement Agreement (75 percent in FY2003 and each fiscal year thereafter) and all dividend and interest income and all realized capital gains on investment of the monies in the Millennium Trust shall be allocated to the Millennium Trust.  However, beginning in FY2012, after the balance in the Millennium Trust reaches $1.38 billion, the monies shall be allocated to the TOPS Fund, one of the Millennium Trust sub-accounts, and investment earnings from the Millennium Trust will be split one-third each between all three Millennium Trust sub-accounts the Education Excellence Fund, the Health Excellence Fund and the TOPS Fund.  Only investment earnings and certain monies allocated to the TOPS Fund and Health Excellence Fund may be spent as specified.  
LA CONST., Art. VII, Sect. 10.8 (2011).

The state also established the Louisiana Fund which receives the rest of the MSA proceeds and all investment income from the Louisiana Fund.  Appropriations from the Fund are limited to the following specified purposes: 1) initiatives for children through enhancements in education and health care; 2) provision of direct health care for tobacco-related illnesses; 3) initiatives to benefit the citizens of the state with respect to health care; 4) initiatives to diminish tobacco-related injury and death to Louisiana&apos;s citizens. 
LA CONST., Art. VII, Sect. 10.9 (2000).

The Louisiana legislature may provide, by a 2/3 vote in both houses of the legislature, for the deposit of all or portion of the MSA proceeds into a special trust fund in the state treasury called the Millennium Leverage Fund.   A two-thirds vote of the legislature provides for the issuance of revenue bonds secured by monies in the Leverage Fund in amounts authorized by the legislature.  Bond proceeds must be appropriated 25 percent each to the Health Excellence, Education Excellence, TOPS, and Louisiana Funds to be used for the specified purposes of each fund.  Termination of the deposit of settlement revenues into the Leverage Fund is allowed pursuant to a two-thirds vote of the legislature.
