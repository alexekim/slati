<Description>It is unlawful to sell, deliver, barter, or furnish, directly or indirectly, any tobacco product to any person less than 18 years of age.  Violation is a misdemeanor of the second degree punishable by a fine of $500, repeat violations within one year are a misdemeanor of the first degree punishable by a $1,000 fine for a second violation, $2,000 fine and 20 day suspension of the retailer&apos;s permit for a third violation, and revocation of a retailer&apos;s cigarette permit for a fourth and subsequent violations.  All civil penalties may be substituted with license or permit suspensions using the ratio of one day for each $50.  A person charged with a violation has a complete defense if a prudent person would believe the buyer or recipient to be 18 years of age or older; the buyer falsely evidenced that they were 18 years of age or older; and carefully checked specified forms of identification and acted in good faith and in reliance upon the representation and appearance of the buyer or recipient in the belief that the buyer or recipient was 18 years of age or older. 
FLA. STAT. ch. 569.101 &amp; FL ADMIN. CODE § 61A-2.022 (1997).

The Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco may mitigate penalties imposed against a dealer because of an employee&apos;s illegal sale of a tobacco product to a minor if they qualify as a responsible retail dealer; the dealer provided the training program required to the employee before the violation occurred; and the dealer had no knowledge of that employee&apos;s violation at the time of the violation and did not direct, approve, or participate in the violation.
FLA. STAT. ch. 569.008 (1997).

<Description>A retailer must obtain an appropriate license from the Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco before accepting a delivery sale of tobacco products defined as sales of tobacco products by phone, fax, mail, delivery service or the Internet.  Delivery sales of tobacco products to persons under 18 are prohibited. Each person accepting an order for a delivery sale must comply with: 1) specific age verification requirements, including obtaining a certification with certain information from the prospective customer and making a good faith effort to verify the information in the certification against a commercially available database as specified or by obtaining a photocopy or other image of government-issued ID; 2) specific disclosure requirements; 3) specific shipping requirements, including use of a method of mailing, shipping, or delivery which obligates the delivery service to require a person over 18 to sign for the shipping container and show photo ID if they appear to be under age 27; 4) specific registration and reporting requirements; 5) specific tax collection requirements; 6) specific licensing and tax stamp requirements; and 7) all laws of this state generally applicable to sales of tobacco products occurring entirely in this state which impose excise taxes and assessments.Violation of the above requirements by an adult is a misdemeanor of the first degree punishable as specified and is subject to: a $1,000 fine or five times the retail value of the tobacco products involved, whichever is greater, for a first offense; and a $5,000 fine or five times the retail value of the tobacco products involved, whichever is greater, for a second or subsequent offense. An adult knowingly submitting a false certification is also a misdemeanor of the first degree punishable as specified and is also subject to for each violation a fine of $10,000 or five times the retail value of the tobacco products involved, whichever is greater. Violation by a person under 18 is a misdemeanor of the 3rd degree punishable as specified.

<Description>In any civil action involving a signatory or a successor, parent or affiliate of a signatory to Florida&apos;s tobacco settlement agreement, the bond required to be furnished during the pendency of all appeals or discretionary appellate reviews of any judgment in such litigation shall be set pursuant to applicable laws or court rules, except that the total cumulative value of the bond to stay execution of the judgment may not exceed $100 million for all appellants collectively, regardless of the total value of the judgment.  In civil actions against the same entities above, brought by or on behalf of persons who claim or have been determined to be members of a former class action that was decertified in whole or in part, the trial courts shall automatically stay the execution of any judgment, upon provision of security as required, see statute cited for further details.  If, after notice and hearing, a plaintiff proves by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant who posted such bond or equivalent surety is purposefully dissipating assets outside the ordinary course of business to avoid payment of the judgment, the court may enter necessary orders as to that defendant to protect the plaintiff, including an order that the bond or equivalent surety be posted in an amount up to the full amount of the judgment against that defendant.  This section does not apply to any past, present, or future action brought by the State of Florida against one or more signatories to the settlement agreement. 
FLA STAT. ch. 569.23 (2009).

In any civil action that is brought as a certified class action, the trial court, upon the posting of a bond or equivalent surety as provided in this section, shall stay the execution of any judgment, or portion thereof, entered on account of punitive damages pending completion of any appellate review of the judgment.  The required bond or equivalent surety acceptable to the court for imposition of the stay shall be the lower of: the amount of the punitive-damages judgment, plus twice the statutory rate of interest; or 10 percent of the net worth of the defendant as determined by applying generally accepted accounting principles to the defendant&apos;s financial status as of December 31 of the year prior to the judgment for punitive damages; provided that in no case shall the amount of the required bond or equivalent surety exceed $100 million, regardless of the amount of punitive damages.  If, at any time after notice and hearing, the court finds that a defendant who has posted a bond or equivalent surety is purposefully moving assets with the intent to avoid the punitive damages judgment, the court shall increase the bond or equivalent surety to the amount of the punitive damages judgment, plus twice the statutory rate of interest.  If the defendant does not post the additional bond required by the court, the stay shall be revoked.</Description>

<Description>Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment in November 2006 that will dedicate 15 percent of future tobacco settlement payments, adjusted for inflation each year, to the state tobacco control and prevention program.  Implementing legislation was approved in May 2007 and the program took effect in the fiscal year starting July 1, 2007 (FY2008).
FL CONST. Art. X § 27 (2006) &amp; FLA. STA. ch. 381.84 (2007).

Money from the state of Florida&apos;s tobacco settlement is initially deposited into the Department of Financial Services Tobacco Settlement Clearing Trust Fund.  Monies are then allocated to the Department of Health Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund, the Department of Children and Family Services Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund, the Agency for Healthcare Administration Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund, the Department of Elderly Affairs Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund, the Biomedical Research Trust Fund in the Department of Health or the Agency for Persons with Disabilities Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund as appropriated by the legislature.

In 1999, the legislature established the Lawton Chiles Endowment Fund for Health &amp; Human Services, and transferred $1.1 billion in FY2000, and $200 million in FY2001, FY2002 &amp; FY2003 from the Tobacco Settlement Clearing Trust Fund.  The earnings of the endowment are appropriated through the general budget process to various agency trust funds by the legislature to help fund specified programs.  However, appropriations bills passed in 2008 and 2009 allowed some principal in the fund to be diverted to other programs/purposes.</Description>
