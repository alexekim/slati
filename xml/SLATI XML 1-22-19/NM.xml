<Description>It is unlawful for an employer to refuse to hire or discharge any individual, or otherwise disadvantage any individual, with respect to compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment because the individual is a smoker or non-smoker, provided that the individual complies with applicable laws or policies regulating smoking on the premises of the employer during working hours.  It is also unlawful for an employer to require as a condition of employment that any employee or applicant for employment abstain from using tobacco products during non-working hours.  This does not apply to any activity that materially threatens an employer&apos;s legitimate conflict of interest policy reasonably designed to protect the employer&apos;s trade secrets, proprietary information or other proprietary interests; or relates to a bona fide occupational requirement and is reasonably and rationally related to the employment activities and responsibilities of a particular employee or a particular group of employees, rather than to all employees of the employer.  Any employee claiming to be aggrieved by any unlawful action of any employer may bring a civil suit for damages.</Description>

<Description>The Tobacco Settlement Permanent Fund was established in the state treasury where all Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) payments are distributed to.  In FY2007 and each fiscal year thereafter, 50 percent of the money in each fiscal year is transferred to the Tobacco Settlement Program Fund until that amount is less than an amount equal to four and seven-tenths percent of the average of the year-end market values of the Tobacco Settlement Permanent Fund for the immediately preceding five calendar years.  In FY2016, the other 50 percent of remaining MSA dollars transferred to the Tobacco Settlement Permanent Fund in that fiscal year was transferred to the Tobacco Settlement Program Fund.  The Tobacco Settlement Permanent Fund is considered a reserve fund of the state, and the legislature may authorize a transfer to the general fund under certain circumstances.
N.M. STAT. ANN. § 6-4-9 (2015).

The Tobacco Settlement Program Fund is also created in the state treasury and monies in the fund shall consist of distributions made to the fund from the Tobacco Settlement Permanent Fund.  Money may be appropriated from the program fund for health and educational purposes, including support of additional public school programs, including extracurricular and after-school programs designed to involve students in athletic, academic, musical, cultural, civic, mentoring and similar types of activities; any health or health care program or service for prevention or treatment of disease or illness; basic and applied research conducted by higher educational institutions or state agencies addressing the impact of smoking or other behavior on health and disease; public health programs and needs; and tobacco use cessation and prevention programs, including statewide public information, education and media campaigns beginning in FY2002.</Description>
