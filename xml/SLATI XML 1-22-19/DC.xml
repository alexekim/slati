<Description>A Community Health Care Financing Fund was established within the city general fund where proceeds from the 2006 sale of future MSA payments and other revenue as specified was deposited.  Money in the fund shall be used to directly pay to promote health care and for the delivery of health care related services in the District, including the construction of health care facilities and the operation of health care related programs.  The monies were then allocated for a number of specific purposes, including a three-year tobacco prevention and cessation program called the DC Tobacco-Free Families Campaign. That program is no longer operating due to loss of funding, but additional money has been allocated from the fund for tobacco control programs/initiatives.
