<Citation>J.T.R. Colebrook, Inc. v. Town of Colebrook (2003).</Citation>
<Description>Stronger local laws/ordinances further restricting smoking are specifically not allowed due to a court decision, see below.

The New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the New Hampshire state Clean Indoor Air Act (N.H. REV. STAT. ANN. §§ 155:64 to 155:78) constitutes a comprehensive and detailed statutory scheme, and because there was no provision permitting additional municipal regulation, the state law preempts local ordinances regarding indoor smoking more stringent than state law.</Description>
