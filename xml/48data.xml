Upon conviction, a court shall suspend execution of the sentence and require the youth to attend a tobacco or e-cigarette awareness program approved by the commissioner or if the program is not available, eight to 12 hours of tobacco or e-cigarette-related community service. The court may require the parent or guardian of the defendant to attend the tobacco or e-cigarette awareness program with the youth. If the tobacco awareness program or community service requirement is completed satisfactorily, the fine will be reduced or eliminated.

<Description>Each manufacturer shall file with the Department of Health an annual report for each cigarette or tobacco product distributed in this state, stating the identity of each ingredient in the cigarette or tobacco product listed in descending order according to weight, measure, or numerical count, other than: tobacco; water; or reconstituted tobacco sheet made wholly from tobacco.  They shall also report the nicotine yield rating for the cigarette or tobacco product.  This section does not require a manufacturer to disclose the specific amount of any ingredient in a cigarette or tobacco product if that ingredient has been approved as safe when burned and inhaled by the United States Food and Drug Administration or a successor entity.   Each manufacturer shall also assign a nicotine yield rating to each cigarette or tobacco product distributed in the state.  The department standards must be developed so that the nicotine yield rating reflects, as accurately as possible, nicotine intake for an average consumer of the cigarette or tobacco product.  The information included in these reports is public information and is not confidential, unless it is determined by the Attorney General that it&apos;s disclosure would constitute an unconstitutional taking of property; if the department determines that there is no reasonable scientific basis for concluding that the availability of the information could reduce risks to public health; or the information is determined a trade secret under state or federal law.  Failing to file the required report can result in a prohibition on the sale or distribution in this state of a cigarette or tobacco product manufactured by the manufacturer by court order.</Description>

<Description>When a judgment is for money, the amount of security to suspend execution of the judgment during appeal of the judgment must equal the sum of costs and compensatory damages awarded in the judgment and interest from the expected duration of appeal except the security required to be posted cannot exceed 50 percent of the judgment debtor&apos;s net worth or $25 million, whichever is less.  On a showing by the judgment debtor that the judgment debtor is likely to suffer substantial economic harm if required to post security in the required amount the trial court shall lower the amount of the security to an amount that will not cause the judgment debtor substantial economic harm.  Nothing in this section prevents a trial court from enjoining the judgment debtor from dissipating or transferring assets to avoid satisfaction of the judgment, but the trial court may not make any order that interferes with the judgment debtor&apos;s use, transfer, conveyance, or dissipation of assets in the normal course of business.</Description>
