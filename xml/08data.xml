<Description>The Tobacco Tax Cash Fund is created in the state treasury.  All moneys from the cigarette tax (64 cents per pack) imposed pursuant to Art. X, Sect. 21 of the Colorado Constitution is deposited in this fund.  All interest and income from monies in the cash fund shall also be credited to the cash fund, except in FY2009 through FY2012 the interest and income shall be deposited in the state general fund.  In each fiscal year, three percent of the money deposited in the fund plus three percent of the interest earned from moneys in the fund shall be appropriated to the state general fund, the old-age pension program and municipal and county governments to compensate for lost tax revenue from lower tobacco product sales, except in FY2009 through FY2012 only 3 percent of money in the cash fund was appropriated.  The three percent allocation to the state general fund is divided up as follows: 1) 20 percent to the state general fund for health-related services (50 percent of this is spent on providing immunizations in certain areas of the state and the other 50 percent for expenditures in the Children&apos;s Basic Health Plan); 2) 50 percent to provide health-related services under the &quot;Colorado Medical Assistance Act for persons who qualify to receive old age pensions; and 3) 30 percent to the Department of Revenue to be transferred to municipal and county governments as specified.  The Health Care Expansion Fund, Primary Care Fund, Tobacco Education Programs Fund, and the Prevention, Early Detection and Treatment Fund are also created in the state treasury, which will receive 46 percent, 19 percent, 16 percent and 16 percent respectively of the moneys deposited in the Tobacco Tax Cash Fund plus the same respective percentages of the interest from monies in the Tobacco Tax Cash Fund in each fiscal year, except in FY2009 through FY2012 as specified above.  Any interest and income earned from monies in the respective funds during FY2009 through FY2012 are also transferred to the state general fund.  The Tobacco Education Programs Fund money is used to fund the state tobacco prevention/cessation program, enforce laws prohibiting tobacco sales to minors through the Division of Liquor Enforcement in the Department of Revenue and providing matching funds to the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing to obtain federal matching funds for the state tobacco quitline.  This portion of the cigarette tax is levied pursuant to a constitutional amendment passed by voters in November 2004.
COLO. REV. STAT. ANN. § 24-22-117 (2012).

Of the revenue generated from the 20 cents of the cigarette tax enacted by the legislature pursuant to the statute cited below, 15 percent goes to the general fund and 85 percent goes to the old-age pension fund.</Description>

<Citation>COLO. REV STAT ANN. § 24-22-115.5 (2007).</Citation>
<Description>The Tobacco Litigation Settlement Cash Fund was created to receive annual Master Settlement Agreement payments. Interest from the investment of these funds starting in FY2002 is credited to the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Fund.  This money is available for expenditure by the legislature each year on specified programs as detailed in paragraphs below. The Tobacco Settlement Defense Account was created as a separate account in the cash fund, receives settlement funds to compensate for defending the state against settlement related court cases/actions and is used by the Department of Law and Department of Revenue for specified purposes. The Healthcare Supplemental Appropriations and Overexpenditures Account was also created in the cash fund. Interest earned on any moneys in the healthcare account is credited to the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Fund.  Any money not used remaining in this account as of June 30, 2012 will be deposited in the general fund.    
COLO. REV STAT ANN. § 24-22-115 (2015).

Except as specified in subsections 1.3 and 5 of 24-75-1104.5 of the Colorado Revised Statutes and excluding disputed payments received by the state in FY2014 and each fiscal year thereafter from the calculations below, MSA money in the Tobacco Litigation Settlement Cash Fund is distributed to the following programs per fiscal year starting in FY2004 from settlement payments received in the previous fiscal year: 1) 19 percent (changes in subsequent fiscal years) to the Colorado Nurse Home Visitor Program, less $1 million that is transferred to the Tobacco Settlement Defense Account of the Tobacco Litigation Settlement Cash Fund; 2) Through FY2015-2016, 27 percent not to exceed $33 million to the Children&apos;s Basic Health Plan Trust, if in any fiscal year this percentage does not equal $17.5 million money can be taken from other places as specified; 3) $200,000 to the State Dental Loan Repayment Program; 4) the lesser of the amount due to any lessor during the fiscal year under a lease-purchase agreement authorized pursuant to section 3 of House Bill 03-1256 or 8 percent not to exceed $8 million to the Fitzsimons Trust Fund; 5) 1 percent not to exceed $1 million in any fiscal year to the Colorado state veterans trust fund; 6) 5 percent not to exceed $8 million to the early literacy fund; 7) 4 percent not to exceed $5 million to the Tony Grampsas Youth Services Program; 8) 3.5 percent not to exceed $5 million to the Drug Assistance Program; 9) $300,000 to pay the state&apos;s share of the &quot;Child Mental Health Treatment Act&quot;; 10) $1 million to the Autism Treatment Fund to pay a portion of the state&apos;s share of the annual funding required by the &quot;Home and Community Based Services for Children with Autism Act&quot;; and 11) 2 percent not to exceed $2 million to the Colorado HIV and AIDS Prevention Grant Program. 
COLO. REV STAT ANN. § 24-75-1104.5(1) (2015). 

For the FY2013 and future fiscal years, the lesser of all settlement moneys received or the following amounts of settlement moneys shall be allocated in each fiscal year in which the state receives the moneys in the percentages or amounts specified and for the programs, services, and funds specified in subsections (1) and (1.5) of section 24-75-1104.5 Colorado Statutes.  For the FY2014 to FY2017 &amp; FY2019 and future fiscal years, the amount allocated pursuant to this subsection 1.3 for the prior fiscal year less the amount of any disputed payments in the Tobacco Litigation Settlement Trust Fund that were credited to the fund pursuant to section 5(a)(I) of section 24-75-1104.5 Colorado Statutes and less the amount of unexpended and unencumbered moneys remaining in the Tobacco Litigation Settlement Cash Fund at the end of the prior fiscal year.  For FY2018, the allocation is slightly different.  In addition, for FY2013 and future fiscal years, in addition to the amounts allocated above, the amount of unexpended and unencumbered moneys remaining in the Tobacco Litigation Settlement Cash Fund at the end of the prior fiscal year shall be allocated to the programs that receive settlement moneys pursuant to subsections (1) and (1.5) of this section in proportion to their shares of the settlement moneys.  In addition, for FY2014 and future fiscal years, in addition to the amounts allocated above, disputed payments received are allocated in the year received up to the amounts necessary to meet the requirements of subsections (1) and (1.5) of this section in the percentages and amounts specified and for the programs, services, and funds specified.
COLO. REV STAT ANN. § 24-75-1104.5(1.3) (2014).

In FY2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, any MSA payments received and allocated in the current fiscal year and the portion of all other settlement monies received by the state in the preceding fiscal year remaining after the programs in sub-section 1 of 24-75-1104.5 Colorado Revised Statutes above have been fully funded are distributed as follows: 1) 49 percent to the University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center; 2) 12 percent to Offender Mental Health Services Fund; 3) 7 percent to the Public Health Services Support Fund; 4) 14.5 percent to the Children&apos;s Basic Health Plan Trust; 5) 4.5 percent to the Supplemental State Contribution Fund; 6) 4 percent to the Supplemental Tobacco Litigation Settlement Moneys Account of the Colorado Immunization Fund; 7) 3 percent to the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Community Prevention and Treatment Fund  via the Department of Human Services as specified; 8) $250,000 to the Colorado Health Service Corps Fund; and 9) $89,000 to the state Auditor&apos;s office for implementing a specified provision.  In FY2012 and each fiscal year thereafter, unexpended and unencumbered dollars and any interest generated from that money transferred to some of these programs/funds is transferred to the state general fund at the end of the fiscal year.      
COLO. REV STAT ANN. § 24-75-1104.5(1.5) (2013).

The state treasurer shall credit all disputed payments upon receipt to the Tobacco Litigation Settlement Cash Fund, except any disputed payments received that are not allocated under subsection 1.3 of 24-75-1104.5 Colorado Revised Statutes (see above) are transferred to the state general fund.  &quot;Disputed payments&quot; means payments of settlement moneys received by the state from participating manufacturers on or after July 1, 2008, in regard to the maximum potential NPM adjustment allocable share applicable to Colorado for any year, as calculated by the independent auditor, and any earned income or interest associated with the payments.
COLO. REV STAT ANN. § 24-75-1104.5(5) (2014).

The Tobacco Litigation Settlement Trust Fund was also created.  The principal of the trust fund consists of the first $33 million in moneys received from the tobaco MSA and up to 21 percent of the money from the MSA payment received in fiscal year 2005/2006 based on the previous fiscal year settlement payment amount minus a required appropriation to the general fund.  The principal of the fund shall not be expended for any purpose except that money may be appropriated to the Children&apos;s Basic Health Plan Trust.  The interest shall be credited to the fund, but shall be available for expenditure when the amount of interest is sufficient to fund current programs funded through MSA money.</Description>
