# SLATI (State Legislated Actions on Tobacco Issues)
This repository was created as part of a project to migrate SLATI from http://lungusa2.org/slati/ to Lung.org. The old site is/was hosted on Rackspace, which we want to shutdown. There is a State Tobacco Cessation site hosted on the same server which we are looking to shut down as well.

## 1) Static content
 These pages are simply copies of the originals. HTML content with nothing dynamically loading.
 - PDFs, resources
 - about.html

 - factsheets_tobaccopolicyreports....html
 - smokefreelaws.html
 - tobacco_control.html

## 2) Dynamically Loading Content

These pages use AJAX calls from XML files to load content. These XML files are produced via Microsoft Access that Thomas Carr (thomas.carr@lung.org) controls and provides.
